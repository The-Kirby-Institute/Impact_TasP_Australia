	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to estimate per-contact probability of HIV transmission in homosexual men due to unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the era of HAART. DESIGN: Data were collected from a longitudinal cohort study of community-based HIV-negative homosexual men in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: A total of 1427 participants were recruited from June 2001 to December 2004. They were followed up with 6-monthly detailed behavioral interviews and annual testing for HIV till June 2007. Data were used in a bootstrapping method, coupled with a statistical analysis that optimized a likelihood function for estimating the per-exposure risks of HIV transmission due to various forms of UAI. RESULTS: During the study, 53 HIV seroconversion cases were identified. The estimated per-contact probability of HIV transmission for receptive UAI was 1.43\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-2.85] if ejaculation occurred inside the rectum, and it was 0.65\% (95\% CI 0.15-1.53) if withdrawal prior to ejaculation was involved. The estimated transmission rate for insertive UAI in participants who were circumcised was 0.11\% (95\% CI 0.02-0.24), and it was 0.62\% (95\% CI 0.07-1.68) in uncircumcised men. Thus, receptive UAI with ejaculation was found to be approximately twice as risky as receptive UAI with withdrawal or insertive UAI for uncircumcised men and over 10 times as risky as insertive UAI for circumcised men. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that a high proportion of HIV-infected men are on antiretroviral treatment and have undetectable viral load, the per-contact probability of HIV transmission due to UAI is similar to estimates reported from developed country settings in the pre-HAART era.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality in HIV-infected patients who have access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has declined in sub-Saharan Africa, but it is unclear how mortality compares to the non-HIV-infected population. We compared mortality rates observed in HIV-1-infected patients starting ART with non-HIV-related background mortality in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients enrolled in antiretroviral treatment programmes in Côte d'Ivoire, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe were included. We calculated excess mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Expected numbers of deaths were obtained using estimates of age-, sex-, and country-specific, HIV-unrelated, mortality rates from the Global Burden of Disease project. Among 13,249 eligible patients 1,177 deaths were recorded during 14,695 person-years of follow-up. The median age was 34 y, 8,831 (67\%) patients were female, and 10,811 of 12,720 patients (85\%) with information on clinical stage had advanced disease when starting ART. The excess mortality rate was 17.5 (95\% CI 14.5-21.1) per 100 person-years SMR in patients who started ART with a CD4 cell count of less than 25 cells/microl and World Health Organization (WHO) stage III/IV, compared to 1.00 (0.55-1.81) per 100 person-years in patients who started with 200 cells/microl or above with WHO stage I/II. The corresponding SMRs were 47.1 (39.1-56.6) and 3.44 (1.91-6.17). Among patients who started ART with 200 cells/microl or above in WHO stage I/II and survived the first year of ART, the excess mortality rate was 0.27 (0.08-0.94) per 100 person-years and the SMR was 1.14 (0.47-2.77). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality of HIV-infected patients treated with combination ART in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be higher than in the general population, but for some patients excess mortality is moderate and reaches that of the general population in the second year of ART. Much of the excess mortality might be prevented by timely initiation of ART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insufficient data are available from single cohort studies to allow estimation of the prognosis of HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive patients who start highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The ART Cohort Collaboration, which includes 13 cohort studies from Europe and North America, was established to fill this knowledge gap. METHODS: We analysed data on 12,574 adult patients starting HAART with a combination of at least three drugs. Data were analysed by intention-to-continue-treatment, ignoring treatment changes and interruptions. We considered progression to a combined endpoint of a new AIDS-defining disease or death, and to death alone. The prognostic model that generalised best was a Weibull model, stratified by baseline CD4 cell count and transmission group. FINDINGS During 24,310 person-years of follow up, 1094 patients developed AIDS or died and 344 patients died. Baseline CD4 cell count was strongly associated with the probability of progression to AIDS or death: compared with patients starting HAART with less than 50 CD4 cells/microL, adjusted hazard ratios were 0.74 (95\% CI 0.62-0.89) for 50-99 cells/microL, 0.52 (0.44-0.63) for 100-199 cells/microL, 0.24 (0.20-0.30) for 200-349 cells/microL, and 0.18 (0.14-0.22) for 350 or more CD4 cells/microL. Baseline HIV-1 viral load was associated with a higher probability of progression only if 100,000 copies/microL or above. Other independent predictors of poorer outcome were advanced age, infection through injection-drug use, and a previous diagnosis of AIDS. The probability of progression to AIDS or death at 3 years ranged from 3.4\% (2.8-4.1) in patients in the lowest-risk stratum for each prognostic variable, to 50\% (43-58) in patients in the highest-risk strata. INTERPRETATION: The CD4 cell count at initiation was the dominant prognostic factor in patients starting HAART. Our findings have important implications for clinical management and should be taken into account in future treatment guidelines.},

	abstract = {Background A consensus statement released on behalf of the Swiss Federal Commission for HIV/AIDS suggests that people receiving effective antiretroviral therapy�ie, those with undetectable plasma HIV RNA ({\textless}40 copies per mL)� are sexually non-infectious. We analysed the implications of this statement at a population level. Methods We used a simple mathematical model to estimate the cumulative risk of HIV transmission from effectively treated HIV-infected patients (HIV RNA {\textless}10 copies per mL) over a prolonged period. We investigated the risk of unprotected sexual transmission per act and cumulatively over many exposures, within couples initially discordant for HIV status. Findings Assuming that each couple had 100 sexual encounters per year, the cumulative probability of transmission to the serodiscordant partner each year is 0�0022 (uncertainty bounds 0�0008�0�0058) for female-to-male transmission, 0�0043 (0�0016�0�0115) for male-to-female transmission, and 0�043 (0�0159�0�1097) for male-to-male transmission. In a population of 10 000 serodiscordant partnerships, over 10 years the expected number of seroconversions would be 215 (80�564) for female-to-male transmission, 425 (159�1096) for male-to-female transmission, and 3524 (1477�6871) for male-to-male transmission, corresponding to an increase in incidence of four times compared with incidence under current rates of condom use. Interpretation Our analyses suggest that the risk of HIV transmission in heterosexual partnerships in the presence of effective treatment is low but non-zero and that the transmission risk in male homosexual partnerships is high over repeated exposures. If the claim of non-infectiousness in effectively treated patients was widely accepted, and condom use subsequently declined, then there is the potential for substantial increases in HIV incidence.},

	abstract = {Background Roughly 3 million people worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2007, but an estimated 6�7 million were still in need of treatment and a further 2�7 million became infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention eff orts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods We used mathematical models to explore the eff ect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual. Findings The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1\% within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US\$1�7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major eff ect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the evidence on the risk of HIV transmission through unprotected sexual intercourse according to viral load and treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and conference abstracts from 1996-2009. We included longitudinal studies of serodiscordant couples reporting on HIV transmission according to plasma viral load or use of ART and used random-effects Poisson regression models to obtain summary transmission rates [with 95\% confidence intervals, (CI)]. If there were no transmission events we estimated an upper 97.5\% confidence limit. RESULTS: We identified 11 cohorts reporting on 5021 heterosexual couples and 461 HIV-transmission events. The rate of transmission overall from ART-treated patients was 0.46 (95\% CI 0.19-1.09) per 100 person-years, based on five events. The transmission rate from a seropositive partner with viral load below 400 copies/ml on ART, based on two studies, was zero with an upper 97.5\% confidence limit of 1.27 per 100 person-years, and 0.16 (95\% CI 0.02-1.13) per 100 person-years if not on ART, based on five studies and one event. There were insufficient data to calculate rates according to the presence or absence of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, or vaginal or anal intercourse. CONCLUSION: Studies of heterosexual discordant couples observed no transmission in patients treated with ART and with viral load below 400 copies/ml, but data were compatible with one transmission per 79 person-years. Further studies are needed to better define the risk of HIV transmission from patients on ART.},

These projections were evaluated against the target of achieving a 90\% reduction in HIV incidence by 2030 compared with 2010 levels.MethodsA mathematical model was used to project annual HIV incidence for combinations of HIV care cascade targets, testing frequencies, primary prevention coverages and levels of PrEP scale-up.ResultsAchieving 90-90-90 by 2020 was estimated to reduce incidence by 10\% from 2010 levels. Achieving 95-95-95 by 2030 was estimated to reduce incidence by 17\% from 2010 levels, with the first 95 being achievable by testing low-/high-risk MSM two/four times per year respectively. This was improved to a 34\% reduction by including a five-year scale-up of PrEP to 30\% coverage among high-risk MSM; and to 45\% by also increasing MSM condom use from 42\% to 60\%. However, even with 95-95-95, two/four tests per year for low-/high-risk MSM, 100\% high-risk MSM PrEP coverage and 100\% MSM condom use, only an 80\% reduction in incidence was possible by 2030. ConclusionMany countries, particularly those with low HIV prevalence, will struggle to achieve a 90\% reduction in HIV incidence by 2030 even if UNAIDS targets are met.

	abstract = {Abstract Introduction We determined the contribution of undiagnosed HIV to new infections among gay and bisexual men (GBM) over a 12?year period in Australia where there has been increasing focus on improving testing and HIV treatment coverage. Methods We generated annual estimates for each step of the HIV cascade and the number of new HIV infections for GBM in Australia over 2004 to 2015 using relevant national data. Using Bayesian melding we then fitted a quantitative model to the cascade and incidence estimates to infer relative transmission coefficients associated with being undiagnosed, diagnosed and not on ART, on ART with unsuppressed virus, or on ART with suppressed virus. Results Between 2004 and 2015, we estimated the percentage of GBM with HIV in Australia who were unaware of their status to have decreased from 14.5\% to 7.5\%. During the same period, there was a substantial increase in the number and proportion of GBM living with HIV on treatment and with suppressed virus, with the number of virally suppressed GBM increasing from around 3900 (30.2\% of all GBM living with HIV) in 2004 to around 14,000 (73.7\% of all GBM living with HIV) in 2015. Despite the increase in viral suppression, the annual number of new infections rose from around 660 to around 760 over this period. Our results have a wide range due to the uncertainty in the cascade estimates and transmission coefficients. Nevertheless, undiagnosed GBM increasingly appear to contribute to new infections. The proportion of new infections attributable to undiagnosed GBM almost doubled from 33\% in 2004 to 59\% in 2015. Only a small proportion ({\textless}7\%) originated from GBM with suppressed virus. Discussion Our study suggests that an increase in HIV treatment coverage in Australia has reduced the overall risk of HIV transmission from people living with HIV. However, the proportion of infections and the rate of transmission from undiagnosed GBM has increased substantially. These findings highlight the importance of HIV testing and intensified prevention for Australian GBM at high risk of HIV.},

All participants enrolled in the modified intention-to-treat population of the double-blind phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial were eligible for this post-hoc analysis. We calculated the total follow-up time for periods of less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence (15 pills or fewer per month taken systematically or often during sexual intercourse). To estimate the time of HIV acquisition, fourth-generation HIV-1/2 ELISA assays, plasma HIV-1 RNA assays, and western blot analyses were done with use of frozen samples, and the stage of HIV infection was defined according to Fiebig staging. HIV incidence was compared between the two treatment groups among individuals who had less frequent sexual intercourse with high PrEP adherence.

During these periods, participants in both groups reported a median of 5·0 (IQR 2·0–10·0) episodes of sexual intercourse per month and used a median of 9·5 (6·0–13·0) pills per month.

	abstract = {Purpose of review 
        Cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) is the first long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) option approved for virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. In addition, long-acting CAB is a promising agent for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This review focuses on phase 3 clinical trial results and implementation considerations for these long-acting ART and PrEP strategies.
        Recent findings 
        Long-acting CAB and RPV administered every 4 weeks demonstrated noninferiority to oral ART through week 96 in both the ATLAS and FLAIR studies, whereas ATLAS-2M found similar efficacy through 96 weeks when the long-acting injectable ART was administered every 8 weeks instead of every 4 weeks. For prevention, two phase 3 trials were stopped early due to fewer incident HIV infections in participants receiving long-acting CAB every 8 weeks compared with daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate–emtricitabine for PrEP. The long-acting therapies were well tolerated across all clinical trials.
        Summary 
        Clinical trial results support the use of long-acting CAB for HIV PrEP and long-acting CAB and RPV as a switch strategy for adults with HIV-1 who are first virologically suppressed with oral ART. Implementation challenges persist, and data are urgently needed in populations who may benefit most from long-acting therapy, including adolescents, pregnant individuals, and those with barriers to medication adherence.},

	abstract = {Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, but the drugs can be expensive. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cost of HIV management from the Australian healthcare perspective.Methods A Markov cohort model, consisting of 21 health states based on CD4 count and line of ART, simulated disease progression over the lifetime of persons living with HIV. We reported costs using 2019 Australian dollars (A\$) at a discount rate of 3.5\% per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of model inputs, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to calculate the 95\% confidence intervals for the lifetime cost estimate.Results The average discounted lifetime cost of HIV management was A\$282 093 (95\% CI: \$194 198–421 615). The largest proportion of lifetime cost was due to ART (92\%). The lifetime cost was most sensitive to third- and second-line ART costs, followed by the probability of failing third-line therapy for those with a CD4 count of {\textless}200cells/μL. A 20\% or 50\% reduction in patented ART costs would reduce the lifetime cost to A\$243 638 and A\$161 400, respectively. Replacing patented ART drugs with currently available generic equivalents reduced the lifetime cost to A\$141 345.Conclusion The relatively high lifetime costs for managing HIV mean that ongoing investment will be required to provide care and treatment to people living with HIV, and supports the urgent need to avert new infections. Reducing the price of ARTs (including consideration of generic drugs) would have the most significant impact on lifetime costs.},

	abstract = {Background In Australia, the preventative use of antiretroviral drugs [pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment as prevention] is being embraced to protect individuals at high risk of HIV and reduce onward transmission. Methods: The adaptation of a behavioural surveillance system, the Gay Community Periodic Surveys, was reviewed to monitor the uptake and effect of new prevention strategies in Australia’s primary HIV-affected population (gay and bisexual men, GBM). The national trends in key indicators during 2000–15 were reviewed and a new measure to take account of antiretroviral-based prevention was developed. Results: Between 2000 and 2015, there were significant increases (P {\textless} 0.001) in annual HIV testing (56.1–64.8\%), condomless sex with casual partners (26.8—38.8\%) and the proportion of HIV-positive men on HIV treatment (72.5–88.4\%) and with an undetectable viral load (73.7–94.7\%). The proportion of casual partners who were HIV negative, not on PrEP and who engaged in receptive condomless sex also increased between 2000 and 2015 from 12.8 to 19.3\%. Two scenarios anticipating the effect of PrEP highlighted the need to target GBM who engage in receptive condomless sex while also sustaining condom use at a population level. Conclusions: Behavioural surveillance can be successfully adapted to follow the effect of antiretroviral-based prevention. It is anticipated that HIV testing and HIV treatment will continue to increase among Australian GBM, but to prevent new infections, intervention in the growing proportion of GBM who have condomless sex with casual partners is needed. For PrEP to have its desired effect, condom use needs to be sustained.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
        There are an estimated 38 million people with HIV (PWH), with significant economic consequences. We aimed to collate global lifetime costs for managing HIV.
        Design: 
        We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020184490) using five databases from 1999 to 2019.
        Methods: 
        Studies were included if they reported primary data on lifetime costs for PWH. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts, and data were extracted from full texts: lifetime cost, year of currency, country of currency, discount rate, time horizon, perspective, method used to estimate cost and cost items included. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the discounted lifetime costs [2019 United States dollars (USD)].
        Results: 
        Of the 505 studies found, 260 full texts were examined and 75 included. Fifty (67\%) studies were from high-income, 22 (29\%) from middle-income and three (4\%) from low-income countries. Of the 65 studies, which reported study perspective, 45 (69\%) were healthcare provider and the remainder were societal. The median lifetime costs for managing HIV differed according to: country income level: \$5221 [interquartile range (IQR)]: 2978–11 177) for low-income to \$377 820 (IQR: 260 176–541 430) for high-income; study perspective: \$189 230 (IQR: 14 794–424 069) for healthcare provider, to \$508 804 (IQR: 174 781–812 418) for societal; and decision model: \$190 255 (IQR: 13 588–429 772) for Markov cohort, to \$283 905 (IQR: 10 558–453 779) for microsimulation models.
        Conclusion: 
        Estimating the lifetime costs of managing HIV is useful for budgetary planning and to ensure HIV management is affordable for all. Furthermore, HIV prevention strategies need to be strengthened to avert these high costs of managing HIV.},

        The purpose of this review is to summarize the current standards of care for both HIV treatment and HIV prevention in 2019.
        Recent findings 
        Current HIV treatment is started as soon as feasible in a person with HIV infection and consists of a three-drug oral daily antiretroviral regimen, consisting of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors combined with a third drug, either an integrase inhibitor, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor. Present treatment regimens are potent, convenient, generally well tolerated and durable, and lead to a normal life expectancy. Present antiretroviral-based HIV prevention strategies focus on treating people with HIV infection with antiretrovirals as soon as feasible to reduce their risk of transmitting to others, and providing two-drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and three-drug post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to those HIV-uninfected individuals who are at risk for HIV infection. PrEP is highly effective when used correctly. Further data on early antiretroviral therapy and PrEP are needed to demonstrate any impact on HIV epidemic control.
        Summary 
        HIV treatment and HIV prevention have improved markedly in recent years due to the development of oral antiretrovirals that are potent, convenient, and generally well tolerated, and lead to virologic suppression and decreased HIV transmission.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
          Determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of single-visit (same-day) antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation compared to standard of care initiation.
          Design: 
          Cost-effectiveness analysis of individually randomized (1 : 1) pragmatic trial of single-visit initiation, which increased viral suppression at 10 months by 26\% [relative risk (95\% confidence interval) 1.26 (1.05–1.50)].
          Setting: 
          Primary health clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa.
          Study participants: 
          HIV positive, adult, nonpregnant patients not yet on ART or known to be eligible who presented at the clinic 8 May 2013 to 29 August 2014.
          Intervention: 
          Same-day ART initiation using point-of-care laboratory instruments and accelerated clinic procedures to allow treatment-eligible patients to receive antiretroviral medications at the same visit as testing HIV positive or having an eligible CD4+ cell count. Comparison was to standard of care ART initiation, which typically required three to five additional clinic visits.
          Main outcome measure(s): 
          Average cost per patient enrolled and per patient achieving the primary outcome of initiated 90 days or less and suppressed 10 months or less, and production cost per patient achieving primary outcome (all costs per primary outcome patients).
          Results: 
          The average cost per patient enrolled, per patient achieving the primary outcome, and production cost were \$319, \$487, and \$738 in the standard arm and \$451, \$505, and \$707 in the rapid arm.
          Conclusion: 
          Same-day treatment initiation was more effective than standard initiation, more expensive per patient enrolled, and less expensive to produce a patient achieving the primary outcome. Omitting point-of-care laboratory tests at initiation and focusing on high-volume clinics have the potential to reduce costs substantially and should be evaluated in routine settings.},

	abstract = {Background High rates of patient attrition from care between HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation have been documented in sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to persistently low CD4 cell counts at treatment initiation. One reason for this is that starting ART in many countries is a lengthy and burdensome process, imposing long waits and multiple clinic visits on patients. We estimated the effect on uptake of ART and viral suppression of an accelerated initiation algorithm that allowed treatment-eligible patients to be dispensed their first supply of antiretroviral medications on the day of their first HIV-related clinic visit. Methods and Findings RapIT (Rapid Initiation of Treatment) was an unblinded randomized controlled trial of single-visit ART initiation in two public sector clinics in South Africa, a primary health clinic (PHC) and a hospital-based HIV clinic. Adult (≥18 y old), non-pregnant patients receiving a positive HIV test or first treatment-eligible CD4 count were randomized to standard or rapid initiation. Patients in the rapid-initiation arm of the study (“rapid arm”) received a point-of-care (POC) CD4 count if needed; those who were ART-eligible received a POC tuberculosis (TB) test if symptomatic, POC blood tests, physical exam, education, counseling, and antiretroviral (ARV) dispensing. Patients in the standard-initiation arm of the study (“standard arm”) followed standard clinic procedures (three to five additional clinic visits over 2–4 wk prior to ARV dispensing). Follow up was by record review only. The primary outcome was viral suppression, defined as initiated, retained in care, and suppressed (≤400 copies/ml) within 10 mo of study enrollment. Secondary outcomes included initiation of ART ≤90 d of study enrollment, retention in care, time to ART initiation, patient-level predictors of primary outcomes, prevalence of TB symptoms, and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. A survival analysis was conducted comparing attrition from care after ART initiation between the groups among those who initiated within 90 d. Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study between May 8, 2013 and August 29, 2014 (median CD4 count 210 cells/mm3). In the rapid arm, 119/187 patients (64\%) initiated treatment and were virally suppressed at 10 mo, compared to 96/190 (51\%) in the standard arm (relative risk [RR] 1.26 [1.05–1.50]). In the rapid arm 182/187 (97\%) initiated ART ≤90 d, compared to 136/190 (72\%) in the standard arm (RR 1.36, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24–1.49). Among 318 patients who did initiate ART within 90 d, the hazard of attrition within the first 10 mo did not differ between the treatment arms (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06; 95\% CI 0.61–1.84). The study was limited by the small number of sites and small sample size, and the generalizability of the results to other settings and to non-research conditions is uncertain. Conclusions Offering single-visit ART initiation to adult patients in South Africa increased uptake of ART by 36\% and viral suppression by 26\%. This intervention should be considered for adoption in the public sector in Africa.

	abstract = {Background Attrition during the period from HIV testing to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is high worldwide. We assessed whether same-day HIV testing and ART initiation improves retention and virologic suppression. Methods and findings We conducted an unblinded, randomized trial of standard ART initiation versus same-day HIV testing and ART initiation among eligible adults ≥18 years old with World Health Organization Stage 1 or 2 disease and CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm3. The study was conducted among outpatients at the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic infections (GHESKIO) Clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard ART initiation or same-day HIV testing and ART initiation. The standard group initiated ART 3 weeks after HIV testing, and the same-day group initiated ART on the day of testing. The primary study endpoint was retention in care 12 months after HIV testing with HIV-1 RNA {\textless}50 copies/ml. We assessed the impact of treatment arm with a modified intention-to-treat analysis, using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential confounders. Between August 2013 and October 2015, 762 participants were enrolled; 59 participants transferred to other clinics during the study period, and were excluded as per protocol, leaving 356 in the standard and 347 in the same-day ART groups. In the standard ART group, 156 (44\%) participants were retained in care with 12-month HIV-1 RNA {\textless}50 copies, and 184 (52\%) had {\textless}1,000 copies/ml; 20 participants (6\%) died. In the same-day ART group, 184 (53\%) participants were retained with HIV-1 RNA {\textless}50 copies/ml, and 212 (61\%) had {\textless}1,000 copies/ml; 10 (3\%) participants died. The unadjusted risk ratio (RR) of being retained at 12 months with HIV-1 RNA {\textless}50 copies/ml was 1.21 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.38; p = 0.015) for the same-day ART group compared to the standard ART group, and the unadjusted RR for being retained with HIV-1 RNA {\textless}1,000 copies was 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.31; p = 0.012). The main limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and the generalizability to other settings is uncertain. Conclusions Same-day HIV testing and ART initiation is feasible and beneficial in this setting, as it improves retention in care with virologic suppression among patients with early clinical HIV disease.

	abstract = {Background
ART is typically begun weeks after HIV diagnosis. We assessed the acceptability, feasibility, safety and efficacy of initiating ART on the same day as diagnosis.

Methods
We studied a clinic-based cohort consisting of consecutive patients who were referred with new HIV diagnosis between June 2013 and December 2014. A subset of patients with acute or recent infection ({\textless}6 months) or CD4{\textless}200 were managed according to a “RAPID” care initiation protocol. An intensive, same-day appointment included social needs assessment; medical provider evaluation; and a first ART dose offered after labs were drawn. Patient acceptance of ART, drug toxicities, drug resistance and time to viral suppression outcomes were compared between RAPID participants and contemporaneous patients (who were not offered the program), as well as with an historical cohort.

Results
Among 86 patients, 39 were eligible and managed on the RAPID protocol. 37 (94.9\%) of 39 in RAPID began ART within 24 hours. Minor toxicity with the initial regimen occurred in two (5.1\%) of intervention patients versus none in the non-intervention group. Loss to follow-up was similar in intervention (10.3\%) and non-intervention patients (14.9\%) during the study. Time to virologic suppression ({\textless}200 copies HIV RNA/mL) was significantly faster (median 1.8 months) among intervention-managed patients when compared with patients treated in the same clinic under prior recommendations for universal ART (4.3 months; p=0.0001).

Conclusions
Treatment for HIV infection can be started on the day of diagnosis without impacting the safety or acceptability of ART. Same-day ART may shorten the time to virologic suppression.},

Effective population-based approaches to decrease HIV incidence are as relevant as ever given modest reductions observed over the past decade. Treatment as prevention is often heralded as the path to improve HIV outcomes and to reduce HIV incidence. Although treatment of an individual does eliminate onward transmission to serodifferent partners (undetectable=untransmittable or U=U), population-level observational and experimental data have not shown a similar effect with scale-up of treatment on reducing HIV incidence. This disconnect might be the result of little attention given to heterogeneities of HIV acquisition and transmission risks that exist in people at risk for and living with HIV, even in the most broadly generalised epidemics. Available data suggest that HIV treatment is treatment, HIV prevention is prevention, and specificity of HIV treatment approaches towards people at highest risk of onward transmission drives the intersection between the two. All people living with HIV deserve HIV treatment, but both more accurately estimating and optimising the potential HIV prevention effects of universal treatment approaches necessitates understanding who is being supported with treatment rather than a focus on treatment targets such as 90-90-90 or 95-95-95.},

	abstract = {Background
Although HIV treatment-as-prevention reduces individual-level HIV transmission, population-level effects are unclear. We aimed to investigate whether treatment-as-prevention could achieve population-level reductions in HIV incidence among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) in Australia's most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria.
Methods
TAIPAN was a longitudinal cohort study using routine health record data extracted from 69 health services that provide HIV diagnosis and care to GBM in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Data from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2019, were linked within and between services and over time. TAIPAN collected data from all cisgender GBM who attended participating services, resided in New South Wales or Victoria, and were 16 years or older. Two cohorts were established: one included HIV-positive patients, and the other included HIV-negative patients. Population prevalence of viral suppression (plasma HIV viral load {\textless}200 RNA copies per μL) was calculated by combining direct measures of viral load among the HIV-positive cohort with estimates for undiagnosed GBM. The primary outcome of HIV incidence was measured directly via repeat testing in the HIV-negative cohort. Poisson regression analyses with generalised estimating equations assessed temporal associations between population prevalence of viral suppression and HIV incidence among the subsample of HIV-negative GBM with multiple instances of HIV testing.
Findings
At baseline, the final sample (n=101 772) included 90 304 HIV-negative and 11 468 HIV-positive GBM. 59 234 patients in the HIV-negative cohort had two or more instances of HIV testing and were included in the primary analysis. Over the study period, population prevalence of viral suppression increased from 69·27\% (95\% CI 66·41–71·96) to 88·31\% (86·37–90·35), while HIV incidence decreased from 0·64 per 100 person-years (95\% CI 0·55–0·76) to 0·22 per 100 person-years (0·17–0·28). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, treatment-as-prevention achieved significant population-level reductions in HIV incidence among GBM: a 1\% increase in population prevalence of viral suppression corresponded with a 6\% decrease in HIV incidence (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·94, 95\% CI 0·93–0·96; p{\textless}0·0001). PrEP was introduced in 2016 with 17·60\% uptake among GBM that year, which increased to 36·38\% in 2019. The relationship between population prevalence of viral suppression and HIV incidence was observed before the availability of PrEP (IRR 0·98, 95\% CI 0·96–0·99; p{\textless}0·0001) and was even stronger after the introduction of PrEP (0·80, 0·70–0·93; p=0·0030).
Interpretation
Our results suggest that further investment in HIV treatment, especially alongside PrEP, can improve public health by reducing HIV incidence among GBM.
